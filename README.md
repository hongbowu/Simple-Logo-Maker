## User Story
As a freelance web developer
I want to generate a simple logo for my projects
So that I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria
Open a command line app that accepts user input
When I am prompted for text
Then I can enter up to three characters
When I am prompted for the text color
Then I can enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number
When I am prompted for a shape
Then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
When I am prompted for the shape's color
Then I can enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number
When I have entered input for all the prompts
Then an SVG file is created named logo.svg
And the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
When I open the logo.svg file in a browser
Then I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Example
For instance, if you input the characters "ABC," choose a blue text color, select a circle as the shape, and set the circle's color to yellow, the program will generate the corresponding SVG code for a logo with the text "ABC" inside a yellow circle.
